My name is Brett Stimmerman. I'm a frontend engineer at [Twitter][1], and an
organizer of [CSSConf][4]. I recently moved to San Francisco where I'm trying
to find room for the home brewing equipment and the truck I'm restoring. Luckily
the stereo, guitars and skateboards fit just fine.

Aside from infrequent blog posts, I often say things on [Twitter][1] and share
code on [GitHub][2].

### About the Site

This site is a collection of my writings about web development and technology.
Posts written between 2005 and 2010 were gathered from a site I no longer
maintain.

These interwebs are made possible by the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) one-two punch.
