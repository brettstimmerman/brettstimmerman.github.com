I've spent most of my life poking at computers to see how they react, and
watching the internet grow up. If I'm not tinkering with computers I can be
found brewing my own beer, wrenching on the pickup I'm restoring, plunking out a
few chords on my guitar and marveling at the universe.

I sometimes say things [on Twitter][2] and share code [on GitHub][1].

### About the Site

This site is a collection of my writings about web development and technology.
Posts written between 2005 and 2010 were gathered from a site I no longer
maintain.

The site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).
