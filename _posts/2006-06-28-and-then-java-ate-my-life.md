            since 2007.

A few months back I started a new job.  A large part of this new job entails
building and maintaining Java desktop applications.  A large part of my life
has recently been eaten away by terse API docs, vague explanations of core and
advanced features, and minimalist and nearly useless code examples of said
features.

Though it's a great change of pace from years of working mainly in PHP, it
means I don't have much free time to work on things I like. At least for a
little while.

I'm hoping that getting back into Java after a 5 year hiatus will be good for
me.  The Java landscape is difficult for me to accurately gauge, but it seems
as though Java on the desktop is trending back into fashion.

Once I settle in to Java and my new role, I hope to be able to pick up my side
projects again.  It's unfortunate, but other projects don't pay the
bills.
