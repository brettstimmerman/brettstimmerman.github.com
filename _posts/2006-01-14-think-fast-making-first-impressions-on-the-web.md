The case for creating visually appealing and usable web sites (and
applications) now has more ammunition. In an article entitled
["Web users judge sites in the blink of an eye"][1], nature.com reports a
university study found that web users make their first impressions much more
quickly than one might expect.

> We all know that first impressions count, but this study shows that the

Fifty milliseconds is incredibly fast: one twentieth of a second, or roughly
half the time it takes to blink.

The article goes on to suggest that overall simplicity, a trend borne of the
the Web Standards movement, is a crucial step towards making a lasting
impression:

> These days, enlightened web users want to see a "puritan" approach ... It's
> about getting information across in the quickest, simplest way possible.

This is hard evidence that we as web designers and developers must create an
excellent and long-lasting first impression, or we are not doing our job.
