[![Graffiti][1]][2]

I walked past this [small delivery truck][2] this morning on my way to work,
and had myself a chuckle. There is plenty of graffiti and tagging that line
the streets of Berkeley and Albany, ranging from the obscure to the obscene.
But until today, none have struck me as being so very appropriate.
