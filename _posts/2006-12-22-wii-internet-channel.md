I am writing this on the Wii Internet Channel. Using the Wiimote to input
large amounts of text is far too painful, and zooming and scrolling around is
a little awkward. Also, using the Wiimote to click on links and other controls
feels clumsy. A keybord/mouse combination would be much nicer. Overall I think
it's a great addition to the Wii.
