[![Ajax Design Patterns book cover][4]][1]

I just stumbled across the Amazon pre-order page for a new O'Reilly book,
[Ajax Design Patterns][1], based on Michael Mahemoff's
[Ajax Patterns wiki][2]. It's set to be released on June 1, 2006.

From the Amazon description:

> _Ajax Design Patterns_ provides best practices for web developers by
> investigating how others have successfully dealt with conflicting design
> principles. You will find sections on foundational technology patterns,
> programming patterns, functionality and usability patterns, and
> diagnosis/testing of Ajax applications. Ajax is all about usability, so the
> patterns in this book focus on delivering usability in the face of
> constraints, such as user capabilities and expectations, bandwidth limits, 
> the stateless nature of HTTP, and the complexity of Javascript.

I'm excited to see a wiki like this published in book form, especially an
O'Reilly book. I'm also excited because [Lace][3] makes an appearance or two.
It might not be much, but it's the first code I've written to be published in
text form on such a massive scale.
